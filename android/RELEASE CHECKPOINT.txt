﻿The purpose of this document is to prepare new_mcare_android project for PROD release.
Please make sure to check all the steps below before building the signed APK for PROD environment:

1. Increment the versionCode and versionName in --- build.gradle ---  file relative to the version in Google Play.
2. Set environment in Hosts.java file environment to PROD.
3. Set API secret in fabric.properties
   a. uncomment the PROD version and comment the DEV version.
4. If not exporting an obfuscated build, delete the existing /app/build and /build/proguard folders (
   there is a bug in build tools that keeps the Proguard setting to true if Proguard has been previously run
   on the project if the above folders are not deleted)

!!! IMPORTANT
5. If not exporting an obfuscated build, make sure that minifyEnabled is set to false in the "release" build config (or the build config that you are using)

6. Export Signed APK using the certificate under /keystore/

The details for the "release" version are:
    Keystore Path: Folder Android Keystore
    keystore pass: vfmcarepass
    key alias: vodafonemcare
    Pass: vfmcarepass


For non-production release please set versionCode and versionName according to current release version and commit it to git.
